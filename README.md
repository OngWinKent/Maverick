### Maverick: Collaboration-free Federated Unlearning for Medical Privacy

### MICCAI 2025

#### (Released on June 18, 2025)

## Introduction

Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training while preserving data privacy, critical for sensitive domains like medical imaging. Regulatory demands for the "right to be forgotten" have driven interest in Federated Unlearning (FU), but existing methods require all clients' participation, posing challenges in privacy, efficiency, and practicability.

We introduce Maverick, a novel FU framework that performs unlearning locally at the target client, eliminating the need for other clients’ involvement. Leveraging Lipschitz continuity, Maverick reduces model sensitivity to unlearned data, ensuring privacy, lowering computational costs, and preserving performance. 

## Getting started

### Environment Preparation

Before executing the project code, please prepare the Python environment according to the `requirement.txt` file. We set up the environment with `python 3.9.12` and `torch 2.0.0`. 

```python
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

### Dataset Preparation
Install [MedMnist](https://github.com/MedMNIST/MedMNIST) dataset:

```python
pip install medmnist
```

Or install from source:

```python
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/MedMNIST/MedMNIST.git
```
